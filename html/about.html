            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <blockquote>
                Pizza House restaurants have been owned and operated by the Tice family since 1986. By using the simple philosophy “good food and great service, your place or ours,” our restaurants have become staples of their communities. There have been many restaurants
                that have come and gone, but townies, visitors, students, and alumni continue to create memories with Pizza House! We value the character of our staff–from management to servers, to everyone in between. They’re the ones who help us maintain
                our success. Our extensive menu is inspired by customer suggestions. If you have one, we want to know about it! We offer convenient hours for both dine-in and delivery service 10:30AM to 4:00AM everyday! With spacious dining areas and
                an extensive menu, we can accommodate groups of any size. We appreciate your business and look forward to many years to come! At Pizza House, we believe in giving back to the community that made us and the people who continue to support
                us. Over the years we’ve provided food and venue space for countless fundraisers and charitable organizations. We also donate over 250 pizzas a year to local schools to auction off at ice cream socials.
